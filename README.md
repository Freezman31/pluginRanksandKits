## ``/unrole <player>`` 
## ``/kitcreate <name> <cooldown in minutes> [permission]`` :
This command open an Interface, where you put the content of the kit, and click on the arrow.
Another interface opens, put the icon of your kit and click on the other block.
Your kit is ready !

If there is any arguments, an Inerface opens and you have acces at all the kits.
Else, if the kit exist, you have the kit.
